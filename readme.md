This was the first project i created in my software engineering course from SDSU's Global Campus

For my Milestone 1 web browser game i decied to make the google dino game. the games frame can shrink and grow in size ajusting to the size of the players browser. it has your standard lose and restart functions that you'd expect from the dino game; game tells you when you can start and restart the game by giving you a message in the middle of the screen.

Main function JUMPING is done usimg "Space" key To restart or start game press "any key" on keyboard

for the sprites i kinda got them from the video i linked below but it wasnt a full on copy paste i recreated the assets in Asprite (a software used for pixel art and animation that i own) after i counted the pixels. probably the biggest waste of time while working on this milestone project but i got to learn a bit of the software

got a massive amount of help and understanding of how everthing should go together from this video by Web Dev Simplified on YouTube https://youtu.be/47eXVRJKdkU some of the functions and variable names are also directly from his video

W3Schools, Mdm web docs, and the tutorial above where all used when i didnt understand how stuff was supposed to go together

I also worked in a group of two others. they aren't in this course they just wanted to refresh themselves before they start their intro to software development at their community college.
